<!-- lab description -->

Our lab is at the intersection of computer science and preventive medicine. Through analysis of continuous streams of data provided by smartphones and wearable sensors, we use signal processing intelligence and machine learning to understand a person’s moment-to-moment behavior, psychological states, and environmental context in which the behavior occurs. We design, build, and analyze end-to-end mobile health (mHealth) systems, while focusing on processing its data to help answer health-related questions.

It is the humanity within us and the desire to improve quality of life and healthcare costs that guide our solutions to the persisting health problems of our time through computer science and behavior science based research in passive sensing data analytics. Our goal is to advance our ability to understand, detect, predict, and ultimately prevent problematic health habits. We are the Health Aware Bits (HABits) Lab!
