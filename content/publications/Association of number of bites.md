### 1. Introduction

Personalized weight management strategies are gaining interest. However, knowledge is limited regarding eating
habits and association with energy intake, and current technologies limit assessment in free-living situations. We
assessed associations between eating behavior and time of day with energy intake using a wearable camera under
free-living conditions and explored if obesity modifies the associations

### RQ1: What associations are there between eating behaviors and energy intake among individuals with and without obesity?

Sixteen participants (50% with obesity)
recorded free-living eating behaviors using a wearable fish-eye camera for 14 days. Videos were viewed by
trained annotators who confirmed number of bites, eating speed, and time of day for each eating episode. Energy
intake was determined by a trained dietitian performing 24-h diet recalls.

### Results

Greater number of bites, reduced
eating speed, and increased BMI significantly predicted higher energy intake among all participants (P < 0.05,
each). There were no significant interactions between obesity and number of bites, eating speed, or time of day
(p > 0.05). Greater number of bites and reduced eating speed were significantly associated with higher energy
intake in participants without obesity. Results show that under free-living conditions, more bites and slower
eating speed predicted higher energy intake when examining consumption of foods with beverages. Obesity did
not modify these associations. Findings highlight how eating behaviors can impact energy balance and can
inform weight management interventions using wearable technology.
