# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter.My research efforts focus on developing data analytic methods and systems to quantify and model behaviors through cutting-edge passive sensing technologies. My lab conducts research developing these systems and methods to understand, detect, predict and ultimately prevent behavioral risk factors (obesity, poor diet, and physical inactivity). I collaborate closely with behavioral intervention researchers in order to design theoretically useful personalized and generalized models, sensors and systems for evidence-based practice.

Passive sensing data analytics: paving the way towards personalized medicine. We design, build and analyze end-to-end mHealth systems, while focusing on processing its data to help answer health-related questions. We focus on signal processing and machine learning techniques to process time-series data generated from passive sensors. To advance existing sensing techniques, a part of our lab focuses on the design of embedded systems. It is the humanity within us and the desire to improve quality of life and healthcare costs that guide our solutions to the persisting health problems of our time through computer science and behavior science based research in passive sensing data analytics; helping us advance our ability to understand, detect, predict, and ultimately prevent problematic health habits. We are the Health Aware Bits (HABits) Lab.
