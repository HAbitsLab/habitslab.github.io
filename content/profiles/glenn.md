I’m a fourth-year PhD candidate at Northwestern University, working with HABits Lab at the intersection of Computer Science and Preventive Medicine. My research primarily focuses on:
(i) user centric design and development of wearable camera systems for tracking human behaviors and providing interventions
(ii) development of explainable machine learning tools to enhance human+ai interaction and decision-making

I love interdisciplinary research, especially research at the intersection of tech, healthcare and data science. I’m motivated and interested to work on projects that integrate software and hardware for developing tools and platforms that can make a widespread impact on people.
